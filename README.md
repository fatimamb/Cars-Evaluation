# Data Scientist Nanodegree Program
Project 4: Cars-Evaluation

**Project Description**

This project (write a data science blog post) is a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
In this project, I have analyzed data publicly available about Car Evaluation and was downloaded from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
also I have used supervised machine learning algorithms Random Forest. 
in this project, I have tried to analyze and answer the following questions:

1 - Is the very good car expensive?

2 - Is the safety will be high on the expensive the cars only?

3 - Is the price of cars affect the price of maintenance?
